Guarantor Form PDF
------------------
Place your BNPL Guarantor Form PDF in this folder. Either filename works:

  Guarantor Form.pdf   (one space before .pdf)
  Guarantor Form .pdf  (space before .pdf)

The file must be a real PDF (not empty; at least a few KB). The dashboard will offer this file when the user clicks "Download Guarantor Form" on their BNPL loan page.
